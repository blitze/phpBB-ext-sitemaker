Now that you have create your menus, you can display them in several ways:

## Links Block

You can use this block to display a flat or nested list of menu items. This block is not intended to be used for navigation i.e. it will not show a current page or anything like that. It is intended for a list of items, including external links.

## Menus Block

This block is intended for site navigation. It does some additional computations to determine current location and is not intended to be a very large list.

## Navigation bar

Similar to the Menus block, the navigation bar will display menu items as a responsive dropdown menu intended for site navigation. You can enable this in ACP > Extensions > Sitemaker > Settings > Select menu
