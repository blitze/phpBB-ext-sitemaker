As of version 3.1.0, phpBB SiteMaker supports the [Responsive Filemanager](http://responsivefilemanager.com)

- The filemanager is used as a tinymce pluging (WYSIWYG editor) when editing custom blocks
- It is currently configured to creat separate folders for each user, except the user with a_sm_filemanager permission (Can see/manage other users' folders), which allows them access to view/manage all upload folders.

## Installation

- Download the responsive filemanager [here](http://responsivefilemanager.com/index.php#sthash.5UrnhjX2.dpbs)
- Extract it, and upload the files to your phpBB root folder. The file structure should be as below:

    - root
      - phpBB
        - ...
        - images
        - includes
        - ...
        - ResponsiveFilemanager

            - config
              - .htaccess
              - config.php
