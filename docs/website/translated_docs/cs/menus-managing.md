## Managing Menus

To manage menus, go to ACP > Extensions > Sitemaker > Menu

### Creating Menus

To create a new menu (group), click on the `Add Menu` button. A new menu group will be created with a randomly generated name. The new menu will also be selected so you can begin adding menu items to it.

### Editing Menus

If you want a more meaningful menu name, * hover over the menu name and click on the cog icon * enter the new menu name and hit enter to update it

### Deleting Menus

To delete a menu, and its items, * Hover over the menu name and click on the **x** icon * If the menu item has no child items, you will need to confirm your choice to delete the item * If the menu item has child items, you will need to indicate if you want to delete only the item and move its children up or if you want to delete the entire branch
