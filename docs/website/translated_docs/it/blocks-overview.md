title: What are blocks?
---
At the heart of phpBB SiteMaker is the concept of blocks. Blocks are little pieces of content that you can place in different pre-defined areas (block positions) on your site. The blocks will typically have settings that you can set/change to fine-tune the content that you wish to display. Most blocks, but not all, will make database queries to get the desired content. So let's not get too crazy :). To manage blocks, you will need to switch to "edit mode".

## Edit Mode

Switch to edit mode by clicking on the pencil icon on the top right of your site. This will display the "Admin bar" with "Blocks" and "Settings" menu items. This is referred to as being in 'edit mode'.
