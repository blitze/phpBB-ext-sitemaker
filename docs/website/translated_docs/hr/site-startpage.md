title: Setting a Start Page
---
phpBB SiteMaker allows you to choose any front controller (pages accessed via app.php/...) as your default start page (the page that will be shown when someone visits your site) instead of the board index.

To do this: * Go to the page that you want to set as default start page * Click on `Settings` in the admin bar. If it is an eligible page, you will see a `Set as start page` button * Click on the `Set as start page` button
