We need help translating this extension, as well as its documentation. We have created a project on Crowdin to ease translations. Crowdin gives you a translation interface that's second to none. You can contribute how ever you want but we really recommend using Crowdin.

> Crowdin is a localization management platform that helps companies to translate their software. You can read more about Crowdin [here](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/)

If you are willing to contribute with translations, you will need:

* A [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/phpbb-ext-sitemaker) account.
* Chose the target language if exist otherwise request to be enabled.

If your desired language is not listed, please [contact me](https://crowdin.com/profile/blitze) and I will add it.
