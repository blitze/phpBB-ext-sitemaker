If the available blocks do not give you the freedom you need, there is the Custom Block which allows you the freedom to display your own content using BBcode or HTML. The block comes with a WYSIWYG editor (Tinymce) and a [Filemanager](./filemanager.md):

**The editor:** * You can use the editor to create HTML content * You can edit the source code if you need that level of control by clicking on the **Source code** icon (**<>**) in the editor * The editor allows you to upload and modify images * The editor filters out any potentially dangerous scripts like javascript, etc. If you need to add content like google ads, the javascript will be filtered out, but you can get around that by doing the following: * Add the Custom Block to desired location * Edit the Custom Block, click on the **Source** tab and paste your Javascript

**The File manager:**

The Custom Block also comes with a [File Manager](./filemanager.md) as a tinymce pluglin * It creates a new folder in phpBB/images/sitemaker_uploads/ for every user who has access to it * You can view/manage all user folders * You can edit images using aviary online editor
